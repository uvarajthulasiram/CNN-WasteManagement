# Waste Material Segregation Using CNN

## Overview
This is my first project in neural networks, aiming to classify waste materials into categories such as cardboard, glass, paper, and plastic using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). 

## Dataset
- The dataset consists of multiple classes of waste images.
- The images were classified and given to us in a .zip file

## Model Training
- Trained a CNN for 50 epochs.
- Training showed gradual improvement in accuracy and reduction in loss.

## Results
- Training accuracy improved from ~14.8% to ~31%.
- Validation accuracy improved from ~9.8% to ~21.5%.
- Validation loss decreased from ~2.95 to ~2.42.
- The model shows a decent classification performance, but there's still scope for improvement.
